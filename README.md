-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Take a user need and break it down to its component pieces. A user story features a high level of what the user wants followed by a requirements list for the developers read. This list defines how this user story can be integrated into the program.
-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing a program is multi-step process. It requires a high level of attention to detail, planning, and transparency among team-members. Some key agile practices to include are communnication, constant review/feedback loops, and daily meetins to go over progress and deadlines. In the future I will focus on creating a robust visual map that determines all aspects of my software before I begin writing code. This inclused defining classes, functions, and methods ahead of time and then ensuring all concepts proposed connect to and fulfill the main goal of the project.
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It means to be transparent, consistent nad concise within your realm of speciality.
